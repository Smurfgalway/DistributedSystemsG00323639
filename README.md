# Readme File for Project G00323639

<p> This project is for my distributed systems module in college. the project was to use a dynamic web project using jsp and the rmi framework to create an application that can query a dictionary file finding the meaning of the word searched and done using message queing across a local hosted server hoasted on tomcat

My project is able to read in the csv file using my controller class and print it to the console. It is not able to query or search the dictionary file. My jsps are able to navigate between each other but are unable to search. 

my tomcat server works and broadcasts on a local host.


the csv file's destination will need to be changed before running as it is set to the local desitation as I could not get it to read any other way.

the jsp files run by right clicking and running them on the local host. Hello world is the intial jsp file and will navigate to the other 2.
